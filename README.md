# In the End Times – You Will Hear Wars and Rumors of Wars  
### Bible Prophecy Fulfilled in Our Generation (Matthew 24:6)

Dear Reader,  

The topic I am dealing with today is **wars and rumors of wars**, which are occurring in real time across the globe. These events clearly indicate that the **end times** spoken of in the Bible are very near. The escalation of global conflicts in the coming months and years will lead mankind into the most terrible period described in Scripture as the **7-year Tribulation period**.  

The Bible warns us in **Matthew 24:22** that unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved. Today, we are witnessing alarming signs all around us in this very decade.

Jesus Christ Himself prophesied:

> “You will hear of wars and rumors of wars…” – Matthew 24:6  

Even as this article is being written, there are **over 40 major conflicts worldwide**, displacing millions and killing thousands. Conflicts rage in Ukraine, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Yemen, Myanmar, Ethiopia, Syria, and many more regions. Flashpoints such as the South China Sea, NATO borders, Israel–Iran tensions, and global economic wars show that the world is rapidly moving toward large-scale war.

The Bible also declares that **nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom**. The wars of the coming Tribulation period will dwarf even World War I and II.  

To make matters worse, Scripture reveals that the world will move toward a **one-world government**, ruled by a global leader referred to in the Bible as the **man of sin** or **son of perdition**. This ruler will demand worship and total allegiance.

### The Only Escape

There is only **one hope for humanity** — **Jesus Christ**.  
Jesus came to this world 2000 years ago, died for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day, defeating sin, Satan, and death.  

Those who believe in Jesus Christ will be taken in the **Rapture of the Church** before the 7-year Tribulation begins. Those left behind will face unimaginable suffering.

Now is the time to repent and believe in **Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior**. Time is short.
